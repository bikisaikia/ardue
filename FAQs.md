**Q: When I click on the settings field to change the compiler or sketch location no file browser windows open.**

**A:** Sometimes the file browser opens in the background and doesn't come into focus, check all the windows on your desktop environment to see if this is the case.

**Q: I have edited or created some blocks and follow the instructions to include them into Ardublockly, but I cannot see any changes.**

**A:** This could happen if your browser, or the Ardublockly desktop application, is using the cached files. If you are using a web browser make sure you delete your cache or do a hard refresh, if using the desktop application you can achieve this by deleting the folder `appdata`, located inside the `arduexec` folder.
