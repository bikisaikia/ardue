**Q: When I click on the settings field to change the compiler or sketch location no file browser windows opens.**

**A:** Sometimes the file browser opens in the background and doesn't come into focus as expected, check all the opened windows on your desktop environment to see if this is the case.

**Q: I have edited or created some blocks and followed the instructions to include them into Ardublockly, but I cannot see any changes.**

**A:** This could happen if your browser, or the Ardublockly desktop application, is using the old cached files. If you are using a web browser make sure you delete your cache and/or do a hard refresh, if using the desktop application you can achieve this by deleting the folder `appdata`, located inside the `arduexec` folder.
